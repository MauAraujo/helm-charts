recommended flow for making a change:

1. Before working on a change, please check to see if there is already a Github
   issue open for that change.
2. If there is not, please open an issue first. This gives the community
   visibility into what you're working on and allows others to make suggestions
   and leave comments.
3. Fork the ParadeDB repo and branch out from the `dev` branch.
4. Make your changes. If you've added new functionality, add tests.
5. Open a pull request towards the `dev` branch. Ensure that all tests and
   checks pass. Note that the ParadeDB repository has pull request title linting
   in place and follows the
   [Conventional Commits spec](https://github.com/amannn/action-semantic-pull-request).
